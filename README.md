# Train a model to recognize the gender through the images.
① Download the image dataset from http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-deepfunneled.tgz, which contains names and pictures of over 5000 individuals, classified into folders.
② Based on the information provided in the file lfw-deepfunneled-gender.txt, select any 4000 distinct male images and 1200 female images from the downloaded pictures.
③ Use 3500 selected male images and 1000 female images as the training set, and the remaining 500 male images and 200 female images as the test set. To reduce memory consumption, crop each image to a 200x200-pixel center and then resize it to 100x100 for learning.
④ Using PyTorch, train a model with these images to recognize the gender of individuals. There are no specific requirements for the model form and accuracy; feel free to explore different approaches.
⑤ Use matplotlib to display the predicted image results. Displaying one or more images is acceptable.
